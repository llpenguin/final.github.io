     <h4>
      ❤The Wool<br>
The wool fiber is surrounded by flat, overlapping scales. <br>
When processed, the fibers are mixed in their orientation <br>
and the scale edges may point in opposite directions. Therefore, <br>
the orientation of the fiber and subsequently the direction of <br>
the scale edges are random. When wool is subjected to agitation such as felting <br>
-- the edges on the scales come in contact with each other, <br>
and do not allow the wool fiber to slide back, “locking” the fiber into position. <br>
It is not just one or two fibers that are locking together, but literally hundreds <br>
of fibers that come in contact with each other and lock into this position – causing the wool to felt.

     <h4>
      ❤The Felting Needlesfelting needles<br>
The felting needles are a special kind of needle that have tiny barbs on the end.  <br>
The barbs are going in one direction and when the needle is stabbed into the wool the <br>
barbs pull the wool in, but not back out again causing the wool fibers to tangle <br>
and their scales to lock together and felt.</h4>
   <h4>❤The Felting Cushion<br>
    The pillow or cushion is used as a surface to work on. When you stab the needle <br>
    into the wool it needs to have something to go into instead of the table or your leg.</h4>
